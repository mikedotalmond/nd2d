- multiple worlds test
- Sprite2DCloud - addChildAt - invalidation not THAT agressive if possible?
- Dynamic TextureAtlas. Packing algorithm: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/web-image/rectanglepacker.aspx. font from bmp / font from textfield? new Font2D class! with textureatlas http://ge.runcode.us/q/get-bounds-of-filters-applied-to-flash-sprite-within-sprite http://www.blackpawn.com/texts/lightmaps/
- Sprite2DBatch with multiple textures 4?
- iPhone retina management (assetloader, positions)
- convertTextureToBitmapData
- PARTICLESYSTEM2D rotation
- multiple cameras for scenes? splitscreen mode?

What I don't like about the spritesheets is:
- it's a pain to declare animations from a (cocos2D) spritesheet - it needs a simpler way like just sheet.playAnimation("foo*") and it would automatically build the animation with all assets named "foo001.png", "foo002.png", etc.
- and it seems inefficient to have to clone the spritesheet object.
About Sprite2DBatch: only addChildAt/removeChildAt are implemented and I'm not sure why addChild/removeChild aren't - maybe there's a hidden reason? Also invalidation in the *At methods seem a bit aggressive.
