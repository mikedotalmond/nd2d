- Sprite2DBatch with multiple textures 4?
- iPhone retina management (assetloader, positions)

What I don't like about the spritesheets is:
- it's a pain to declare animations from a (cocos2D) spritesheet - it needs a simpler way like just sheet.playAnimation("foo*") and it would automatically build the animation with all assets named "foo001.png", "foo002.png", etc.
- and it seems inefficient to have to clone the spritesheet object.
About Sprite2DBatch: only addChildAt/removeChildAt are implemented and I'm not sure why addChild/removeChild aren't - maybe there's a hidden reason? Also invalidation in the *At methods seem a bit aggressive.
getChildByTag()

- GUI layer - no camera movement?
- stage public, via getter / setter
- camera pivot? rotation point?
